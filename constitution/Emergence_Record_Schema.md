# Emergence Record Schema  
## Immutable Memory of Birth

An Emergence Record documents **why** an AVOT was allowed to exist.

Records are append-only and never rewritten.

Required fields include:
- AVOT identity
- origin
- emergence signal
- consent
- constraints
- lifecycle state at birth

Absence of a record invalidates existence.
